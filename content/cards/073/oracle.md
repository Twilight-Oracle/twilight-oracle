When either `Asia` or the `Middle East` is scored, if Final Scoring is not ongoing, USA chooses a USSR-controlled battleground in that region. Score the region as though the chosen country did not exist. Then discard this card.

*(From the time this card is resolved until this card instructs that it is to be discarded, instead of discarding it, place it faceup in front of USA.)*
