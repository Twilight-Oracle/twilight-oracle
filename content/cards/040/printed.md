Set DEFCON to Level 2. Any further Coup attempt by your opponent this turn, anywhere on the board, will result in Global Thermonuclear War. Your opponent will lose the game. This event may be canceled at any time if the USSR player removes two Influence from Cuba or the US player removes 2 Influence from either West Germany or Turkey.
