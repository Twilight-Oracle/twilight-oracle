Set DEFCON to 2.

Until end of turn, if the enemy launches a coup, that side loses the game.

Until end of turn, at any time, USSR may remove 2 friendly influence from `Cuba` and USA may remove 2 friendly influence from either `West Germany` or `Turkey`; if either side removes friendly influence this way, all of this card's effects end.
