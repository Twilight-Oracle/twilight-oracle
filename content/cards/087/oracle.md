Perform one (USSR's choice):
* Place 4 USSR influence in `Europe`.
* If USSR has more VP than USA, place 6 USSR influence in `Europe`.

Do not place more than 2 influence in a single country.

*Ongoing* — USSR may not choose any country in `Europe` when launching a coup.

*Ongoing* — After USSR resolves `090-L Glasnost`, USSR may spread influence or perform realignments with that card.
