Award USSR 2 military operations.

Roll a die and subtract 1 for each of `Israel` and its adjacent countries that is USA-controlled. If the result is 4 or greater, award 2 VP to USSR, remove all USA influence from `Israel`, and place USSR influence there equal to the amount removed.

*(This card instead does nothing during `065-M Camp David Accords`.)*
