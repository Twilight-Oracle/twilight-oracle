The enemy chooses a card from among the cards in its hand which have the greatest operations value. If the chosen card is aligned with the enemy, you conduct operations with that card. Otherwise, you resolve that card.

Then, put this card in the enemy's hand. The enemy must choose to play this card the next time they complete an action round. The enemy must choose to conduct operations with this card when they play it.
