Gain 2 military operations.

Choose `Iran` or `Iraq`.

Roll a die and subtract 1 for each enemy-controlled country adjacent to the chosen country. If the result is 4 or greater, gain 2 VP, remove all enemy influence from the chosen country, and place friendly influence there equal to the amount removed.
