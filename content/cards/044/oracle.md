*Ongoing* — USSR may only play scoring cards or cards from hand with operations values of 2 or greater. If USSR has no such cards in hand, USSR must choose to play no card in an action round.

*Ongoing* — Whenever USSR plays a card with an operations value, instead of choosing a use for that card, USSR discards it and rolls a die. On a result of 4 or less, all of this card's effects end.

*(Discarded cards are not resolved.)*
